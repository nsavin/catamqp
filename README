catamqp.py is a simple command to listen AMQP server exchange.

Features: 
  * try to decode message body as JSON and format it. 
    Or output as string if failed
  * with key '-t' listen 'amq.rabbitmq.trace' exchange and 
    write output in file (by default, 'trace.log')

Examples: 
  # output on screen messages 
  ./catamqp.py nova
  # write output in file 
  ./catamqp.py -f nova.log nova
  # specify route key 
  ./catamqp.py -r nova.* nova
  # trace messages
  ./catamqp.py -t 
  # trace only publish
  ./catamqp.py -t -r publish.* 
  # output trace on screen instead of file, trace only publish 
  # messages in nova exchange
  ./catamqp.py -t -f - -r publish.nova

Tracing: 
  Rabbitmq has to be >= 2.6. Upgrade if needed. 
  To enable trace:
  * rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_tracing
  * service rabbitmq-server restart
  * rabbitmqctl trace_on
  To disable trace:
  * rabbitmqctl trace_off

  Traced messages publsished in exchange 'amq.rabbitmq.trace', with fields: 
  * routing key 
    * "publish.exchangename", for messages entering the broker
    * "deliver.queuename", for messages leaving the broker
    * "info", "warn", "error" - internal
  * headers containing metadata about the original message: all its headers, properties, and a few other things
  * body corresponding to the body of the original message
